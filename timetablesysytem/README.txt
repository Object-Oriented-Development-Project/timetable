//TIMETABLING APPLICATILON

The program currently requires a user to log in as a student, lecturer or admin. This requires an ID present in the CSV files.
The user can log out to go to the starting menu and log in as a new user, they can also quit to terminate the app.
Timetables can be viewed for rooms, modules, students, lecturers and courses. User timetables are available only when logged in as that user, others require their id to be entered.
Admin requires a password to log in that is case sensitive and can set the term for the system as well as update tables. The process to update a table is given to the admin user within the menu in steps.
All login details are converted to capital letters so match the CSV files, except the admin password.
